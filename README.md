# Hello world!

This repo was created to practice fork and clone. Please follow the steps bellow, happy coding! :rocket:

1. Go to https://github.com/JaimePintoP/cande-test-repo and **clone** the repository

2. Make your changes in the marked `<p>` and leave your friendly message :)

3. Add and commit your changes

4. Push your changes into `main` branch:

   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

You will see an error in the terminal because you are trying to commit some changes in a repository that doesn't belong to you and you don't have the permission to make those changes (the original repository).

### Now let's **fork** the repository before cloning the repo

1.  Go to https://github.com/JaimePintoP/cande-test-repo and **fork** the repository

2.  Then copy the url of your forked repository in GitHub

3.  Go to a folder in your local machine and `git clone <add_your_repository_url_here>`. The "`< >` " are only to show where you need to add some content, they are not necessary so you can delete them

4.  Enter the project's folder

5.  Make your changes in the marked `<p>` and leave your friendly message :)

6.  Add and commit your changes

7.  Push your changes into `main` branch:

    ```
    git push origin main
    ```

In this case, as you forked (created a copy of the original repository) this remote repo does belong to you and you are allowed to make changes.

### What is coming next...

Once you finished this little exercise, we will practice a Pull Request, which is a request to add your code into someone elses repository :)
